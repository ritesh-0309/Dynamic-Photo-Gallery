# 🌆 Dynamic Photo Gallery — Responsive CSS Grid + Lightbox  

A modern, responsive **photo gallery** built using **HTML**, **CSS Grid**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, featuring a beautiful **Lightbox overlay**, **keyboard navigation**, and full **accessibility support**.  

## 🎯 Overview  

This project showcases how to design a **dynamic and adaptive photo gallery** that automatically adjusts to any screen size.  
It’s fast, minimalist, and works flawlessly **without any external frameworks**.  

## ✅ Highlights  

- 🧱 **Responsive CSS Grid** layout that auto-fits images beautifully  
- 💡 **Lightbox modal** with smooth animations and navigation  
- 🎹 **Keyboard support:** use **Arrow keys** to navigate, **ESC** to close  
- ♿ **Accessibility-ready:** ARIA roles, focus trapping, and alt text  
- 🖼️ **Lazy-loaded images** with perfect scaling and sharp rendering  
- ⚙️ **Lightweight:** built with only three files  
- 🌙 **Modern dark-themed design** with soft shadows and glassy overlays  

## 🧩 Technologies Used  

- **HTML5** — semantic and accessible markup  
- **CSS3 (Grid + Variables + Clamp)** — fluid, responsive design  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)** — simple, dependency-free Lightbox logic
